For engineers, one obvious link is that this first artificial satellite opened up our minds to the possibilities of new application areas of engineering.\n\u2022 Communications, for example, would no longer be bound by terrestrial constraints such as the curvature of the earth, the physical barriers presented by the earth\u2019s oceans, the vagaries of atmospheric conditions, and the like.page: 22\n\n\n\u2022 Indeed, the Sputnik Shock is responsible, in many ways, for our modern understanding of what Mokyr (1990) describes as \u201cthe lever of riches.\u201d\n\u2022 In fact, the Sputnik Shock of October 4, 1957, triggered a series of actions and outcomes that first linked Creativity (in the sense of the generation of effective novelty), Innovation (the exploitation of effective novelty), and Engineering (the design and development of technological solutions to problems) together in a systematic and scientific way.page: 23\n\n\nThe Lever of Riches\n\u2022 The Lever of Riches, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of Creativity throughout history, offers telling insights into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.\nTechnological Creativity and Economic Progresspage: 24\n\n\nThe Association between\n    Technological Creativity\n     and Economic Progress\n\u2022 It kick-started a rigorous examination\n   of       the         association                 between               the\n   creation of new products, processes,\n   systems, and services\u2014 technological\n   creativity\u2014and                      economic                 progress\n   that              has              underpinned                         the\n   development and success of nations\n   for centuries.page: 25", "metadata": {}}}
