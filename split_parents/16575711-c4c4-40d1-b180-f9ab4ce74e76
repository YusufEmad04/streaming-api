The Rise of the West\u201d\u2014to a foundation of technological creativity. He contrasted two generic types of person, stating that: \u201cOne [homo economicus] makes the most of what nature permits him to have. The other [homo creatives] rebels against nature\u2019s dictates\u201d.page: 42\n\n\nTHE ECONOMICS OF CREATIVITY\n\nTechnological creativity, like all creativity, is an act of rebellion.\nEconomic progress, built on the foundation of technological creativity, has resulted in a rise in living standards; improved nutrition, clothing, housing, health; reduced toil; and reduced disease. Furthermore, this effect of technological creativity has far outweighed the effort and cost.page: 43\n\n\nTHE ECONOMICS OF CREATIVITY\n\u2022 Mokyr (1990) goes on to explain that\n    economic growth and progress result from four processes: investment,\n    commercial expansion, scale or size effects, and an increase in the stock of\n    human knowledge.page: 44\n\n\nECONOMY \u2022 Economists naturally tend to concentrate on economic explanations, and even where they discuss the role of technological creativity, they tend to do so only in economic terms. Mokyr, however, shows that purely economic explanations may fail to explain adequately the role of technological creativity.\n\nECONOMICS OF CREATIVITY \u2022 3/1/2024 11:54 AMpage: 45\n\n\nENGINEERING AND ENGINEERS                                                                                                                  010\n \u2022 What is it that engineers do?\n \u2022 There is, in fact, a remarkably consistent answer to this\n  question in introductory engineering texts.\n \u2022 Jensen (2006), for example, says that \u201cEngineers solve problems\u201dpage: 46\n\n\nENGINEERING AND ENGINEERS\n\u2022   This process requires the ability to understand and define\n    the problem, to apply standard approaches to solving the\n    problem, and to \u201csupplement the standard solution\n    methods with Creativity and Insight\u201d.page: 47\n\n\nBasic Process\n                 of\n  Engineering\n                              Problem                          Enginleer  Solution\n           3/1/2024 11:54 AM    The basic process of engineering:                   48page: 48\n\n\nEngineer\nNeed             Problem                  Design            Solution\n   Engineering as needs-driven problem solving:\n  Engineering as needs-driven problem solving\n3/1/2024 11:54 AM                                                     49page: 49", "metadata": {}}}
