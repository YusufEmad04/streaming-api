New needs may look similar to past cases, but they are new precisely because they have unique characteristics and constraints that have never been encountered before.page: 52\n\n\nTHE NEED FOR\nCREATIVITY\n\u2022 New solutions are new because they\n   are identified as unique, original, and\n   never           seen         before.           It      is       the\n   characteristic, indeed the requirement,\n   of newness\u2014in the needs and in the\n   solution \u2014that is why creativity is\n   central to engineering problem solving.page: 53\n\n\nNASA myth\n\u2022 The urban myth of the NASA Space Pen illustrates this well. The popular story tells us that NASA spent 10 years and $12 million developing a ballpoint pen that would work in zero gravity and extremes of temperature. Meanwhile, the Soviet cosmonauts simply used pencils. In other words, the myth is making the point that sometimes the old, routine solution is perfectly satisfactory.page: 54\n\n\nEngineer\nChange as Change Need Problem Design Technology\nthe stimulus\nfor\nengineering\nChangeas the stimulus for engineering:\n3/1/2024 11:54 AM 55page: 55\n\n\nChange\nChange as a Engineer\ndriver of needs New need New\nand solutions Problem Design solution\nChange driver ot needs and solutions_\n3/1/2024 11:54 AM 56page: 56\n\n\nSix pathways in engineering problem solving New New need solution START Old Old need solution Stasis Six pathways in engineering problem solving 3/1/2024 11:54 AM 57page: 57", "metadata": {}}}
