It was more\n   than that, however, because it ushered in the Space Age. Although\n   this may seem a somewhat distant and mundane milestone to\n   Generation Y1 and beyond, it is wise not to underestimate the\n   profound impact that this event had on the Western psyche at the\n   time (Dickson, 2001).\n\nGeneration X were born between 1965 and 1980. Next comes Generation Y (more commonly known as Millennials), born\nbetween roughly 1981 and 1994. The youngest generation in today's workforce is Gen Z, meaning Generation Z, who were\nborn between 1995 and 2009. 3/1/2024 11:54 AMpage: 19\n\n\n\u2022 Indeed, that impact has been\n  described as the Sputnik Shock.\n THE SPUTNIK SHOCK (cont..)                                                                        \n                                      \n                                  \u2022 Western                     newspapers                         at        the\n                                      time roared headlines such as\n                                      \u201cRed \u2018Moon\u2019 over London!\u201d and\n                                      \u201cSpace Age Is Here!\u201d\nSUPRGALEAGE EPACE                     \n                                                                                                  3/1/2024 11:54 AM                                                                                      page: 20\n\n\nTechnological Trump Card\n\u2022 Set against the backdrop of the Cold War tension\n   between the Soviet and Western blocs, both sides\u2019\n   preoccupation with nuclear weapons technology, and\n   the recent conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is not\n   difficult to imagine the fear and consternation that this\n   technological trump card engendered in Western\n   countries.page: 21\n\n\nOpened Up Our Minds\n\u2022 As interesting as the history of the early Cold War years is, what is the connection between your navigational problems, the disembodied voice on your smart phone, and Sputnik I? For engineers, one obvious link is that this first artificial satellite opened up our minds to the possibilities of new application areas of engineering.\n\u2022 Communications, for example, would no longer be bound by terrestrial constraints such as the curvature of the earth, the physical barriers presented by the earth\u2019s oceans, the vagaries of atmospheric conditions, and the like.page: 22", "metadata": {}}}
