The thinking skills and strategies people need for creativity (cognitive\nfactors).\n2. The personal and motivational properties that permit and activate these\nskills and strategies (noncognitive factors).\n3. The characteristics of the environment (social and organizational factors)\nthat influence the whole process.page: 8\n\n\n\u201cFast Food\u201d Creativity\n\u2022 An overreliance on the reapplication of tried and\n   trusted methods leaves learners unable to answer\n   questions such as \u201cWhy didn\u2019t this method work in this\n   particular case?\u201d or \u201cWhat method is best suited to this\n   particular group of people?\u201d The shallow, factual-only\n   approach has been characterized as \u201cfast food\u201d\n   creativity (Cropley, 2009).page: 9\n\n\n\u2022 Most people are familiar with Thomas Edison\u2019s famous quote: \u201cGenius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration\u201d (published in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1932).\n\u2022 The same, broadly speaking, may be said of Creativity. Perhaps a better simile is that Creativity is like an iceberg\u2014the end result, in the form of a brilliant new idea, or a novel solution to an intractable problem, is only 10% the whole effort.page: 10\n\n\n\u2022 The other 90% is the complex interplay of personal properties, feelings, motivation,\n   cognitive processes, organizational and social factors that deliver the visible product. If we\n   are to get the best possible result from our creative engineering efforts, we must\n   understand not only the visible tip of the iceberg, but also everything that lies hidden\n   beneath.page: 11\n\n\nWe will discuss\u2026..\n\u2022 Fundamentally, to address the question of how to reconnect Creativity and Engineering. Before embarking on a detailed explanation of the 4Ps of Creativity, what they are, and how they are measured, I will begin by fleshing out two issues already mentioned briefly as important for understanding Creativity in Engineering.page: 12\n\n\nWe will discuss\u2026..\n\u2022 The question of the importance of creativity in engineering.\n\u2022 Why should engineering organizations, their leadership, and their professional practitioners, as well as educational institutions, be concerned with creativity in engineering? What is it that engineers do that requires creativity?\n\u2022 What value does creativity add to products? Also, how does creativity feed the wider process of innovation?page: 13", "metadata": {}}}
