More specifically, Press can be considered to address both (a) how the \u201cclimate\u201d can either facilitate or inhibit creativity, and (b) how the \u201cenvironment\u201d reacts to the production of creativity.page: 38\n\n\n\u2022 Press therefore touches on not only factors such as management support\n   for creativity (e.g., rewarding creativity, encouraging risk taking), and how\n   the physical environment may foster creativity (e.g., through the provision\n   of plants and adequate lighting in the workplace), but also on the way\n   that society tolerates radical deviations from norms (are creative people\n   ridiculed or hailed?), and even the rules and standards that govern\n   professional activities such as engineering.page: 39\n\n\nSummary\n\u2022 There is a tendency to speak of creativity in a global way. However, from early in the modern, post-Sputnik era, it was variously broken into the \u201cThree Ps\u201d (Barron, 1969): Person (who), Product (what), and Process (how), while Rhodes (1961) (p. 305) provided a fourth \u201cP\u201d (Press; i.e., the pressure exerted by the environment, or )where)(.page: 40\n\n\nPerson\nA \"Systems\"\nPress Product Concepts of\nCreativity\nProcess\n3/1/2024 11:54 AM 41page: 41\n\n\nTHE ECONOMICS OF CREATIVITY\nTHE ECONOMICS OF CREATIVITY", "metadata": {}}}
