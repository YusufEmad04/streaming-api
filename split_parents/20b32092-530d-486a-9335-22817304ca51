The\n    Sputnik                    Shock,                   in          short,                started                   a    Psychology  Economics\n    revolution in thinking that has attempted\n    to explain not only the new technology\n    itself, but also who develops the new\n    technology, how and why they develop it,\n    and where this development takes place.page: 26\n\n\nCreativity VS Engineering\n\u2022 Creativity is concerned with the generation of effective and novel solutions to problems.\n\u2022 Engineering is concerned more specifically with generating technological solutions to problems.page: 27\n\n\nCreativity VS Engineering\n\u2022 It stands to reason that successful engineering must focus not only on\n    analysis and convergent thinking, but also on the vital role that synthesis\n    and divergent thinking play in the creation of technology.\n\u2022 Focusing on one at the expense of the other risks not only the integrity of\n    the solutions themselves, but also the skill base of the people involved in\n    the creation of these solutions. Now we concerned with reestablishing\n    and rebalancing the link between creativity and engineering.page: 28\n\n\nWHAT IS CREATIVITY?\nCreativity involves the production of \u201cmeaningful new forms.\u201d such forms involve:\n\u2022 Physical objects that can be made, sold, and used.\n\u2022 Theorems or strategies that can be applied in many situations.\n\u2022 Systems for understanding the world that are adopted by many people.\n\u2022 Music that can be performed again and again.page: 29", "metadata": {}}}
