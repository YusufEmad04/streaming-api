It was more\n   than that, however, because it ushered in the Space Age.

Next comes Generation Y (more commonly known as Millennials), born\nbetween roughly 1981 and 1994. The youngest generation in today's workforce is Gen Z, meaning Generation Z, who were\nborn between 1995 and 2009. 3/1/2024 11:54 AMpage: 19", "metadata": {}}}
