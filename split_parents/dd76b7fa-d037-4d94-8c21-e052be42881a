Cropley\n\u2022 David Cropley is an internationally recognized expert on creativity and innovation. His teaching interests focus on systems engineering and related concepts, and his research examines a range of aspects of creativity and innovation, both in the field of engineering, and more broadly.page: 3\n\n\n\u2022 \u201cInnovation is the only mechanism that can actually change\n    things in substantive ways.\n       INNOVATION\n\u2022 Innovation is where creative thinking and practical know-how\n    meet to do new things in new ways, and old things in new\n    ways.\u201d\nDr. Charles Vest, 1941-2013\nPresident, U.S. National Academy of Engineering, 2007-2013page: 4\n\n\n\u2022 This COURSE provides a set of research-based concepts, firmly grounded in the body of knowledge of creativity, which will help professional engineers, engineering managers, and engineering educators to understand creativity in a systematic way. The material in the book will help these stakeholders to identify its key aspects, develop it in themselves, foster its development in students and professionals, and acknowledge and reward it appropriately.page: 5\n\n\ndosien)) Dea\nYCoamr)QJARV\nPLANNING 9\nCONCEPT\nInspiring\n@OSINGSS\n\u2756To demystify the concept of creativity, i.e., help educators, managers,\npractitioners and students understand it in a practical, concrete way.\n\u2756To show that there is a common core to creativity in all disciplines.\nAIMpage: 6\n\n\nAIM\n\u2756To help people acquire a foundation of creative skills, motives, attitudes, and values from the very beginning.\n\u2756To show educators and managers how to facilitate the development of these through their leadership.\n\u2756To show educators and managers how to evaluate other people\u2019s work in ways that foster creativity.page: 7\n\n\nAIM\nThe approach to Creativity in this COURSE emphasizes three complementary facets:\n1. The thinking skills and strategies people need for creativity (cognitive\nfactors).\n2. The personal and motivational properties that permit and activate these\nskills and strategies (noncognitive factors).\n3. The characteristics of the environment (social and organizational factors)\nthat influence the whole process.page: 8", "metadata": {}}}
