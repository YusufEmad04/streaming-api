A new solution, e.g., an invention or discovery, creates a new, previously unrecognized, need. This is sometimes referred to as technology push, or a supply-side problem. Another label for this pathway is Redirection.\nThis type of problem driver also helps to explain why developing nations, for example, do not simply adopt old technologies as the solution to their needs. We do not see, for example, Afghanistan adopting the steam locomotive as its solution for mass and heavy transport. Nor do we see Afghanis installing a network of hard-wired telegraph stations to meet their communications needs. The availability of new technologies generates an up-to-date and modern need.page: 58\n\n\nIf the primary driver is change, the following pathways can be traced. A new solution satisfies an old need. The wheel, for example, satisfied the need to be able to move large loads easily and quickly, for example for trade or food production. In engineering, this is quite common, and is described by the mantra \u201cbetter, faster, cheaper.\u201d We can also call this Forward Incrementation. Six pathways in engineering; problem solving.page: 59\n\n\nIf the primary driver is change, the following pathways can be traced\n3. A new need is satisfied by a new solution. Change\nThis is often referred to as market pull, or a demand-side problem. We can also call this Reinitiation.

A new need is met with an old solution, which, unable to meet the new need, effectively drags the need back to what can be satisfied\u2014an old need. This pathway has the effect of pulling change back to stasis and can be characterized as Stagnation. This is also what Albert Einstein was referring to when he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t solve problems [new needs] by using the same kind of thinking [old solutions] we used when we created them.\u201d In the end, the new need remains unfulfilled and the progress implicit in change is halted. The reader will also notice that creativity is absent, highlighting the fact that change can only be met successfully with the creativity that is implicit in novelty.page: 61", "metadata": {}}}
