An old, or existing, need is satisfied by an old solution. This case is\ncommon to many engineering scenarios and is, in no way, inferior or\ndeficient. If I need to hammer in a nail, then my trusty old hammer is a\nperfectly good solution. If I need to get traffic across a river, then a\nstandard bridge design will almost certainly be satisfactory. This \u201cmore\nof the same\u201d approach, or Replication, is the bread and butter of\nengineering.page: 62\n\n\nIf the primary driver, by contrast, is stasis,\nthen two pathways exist:\nThis is how engineers provide solutions to many of society\u2019s problems\u2014and satisfy\nneeds\u2014in a cost-effective, timely, safe, and low-risk manner. While it involves no\ncreativity, at least at the macro level, it should not be dismissed for at least two\nreasons.\nFirst, it comprises a large percentage of what engineers do, and second, because there\nmay be a requirement for creativity buried deeper within it. For our current purposes,\nhowever, and for the case where old needs are satisfied by old solutions, we will set\nthis aside as outside the scope of our discussion of creativity in engineering.page: 63\n\n\nIf the primary driver, by\ncontrast, is stasis, then two\npathways exist:\n6. The last pathway is similar to the previous one. The driver\nis stasis, and the only difference is that the starting point is\nan old solution rather than an old need. You might wonder\nwhy someone would start with an old solution rather than\nan old need. This seems a little counterintuitive. Who starts\nby saying, \u201cI have an old bridge here. Where is some traffic\nthat needs to get across a river?\u201d However, it is not as\nunlikely as you might think.page: 64\n\n\n\u2022 Any time we salvage old parts and\n                      reuse them\u2014let us call it recycling\u2014\n                      this is, in effect, what we are doing.\n                      Similarly, there are examples in the\n                      field of systems engineering where\n                      so-called legacy items may be\n                      incorporated into a new system.page: 65\n\n\nFor reasons of cost reduction, increased effectiveness and developmental risk reduction, we may choose to reuse some existing subsystems as part of a larger complex system.page: 66\n\n\nTHANK YQU!\n3/1/2024 11:54 AM              67page: 67", "metadata": {}}}
