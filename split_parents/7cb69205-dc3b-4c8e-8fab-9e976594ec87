Such a definition\n   should be broad enough to satisfy the needs of any domain.page: 31\n\n\nTHE FOUR Ps OF CREATIVITY\n\u2022 The second component needed by engineers for the reconnection\n    with creativity is to recognize that the phenomenon is characterized\n    in terms of 4Ps: Person, Product, Process, and The Press . This\n    conceptual framework was first described by Rhodes (1961) and\n    provides an excellent framework for understanding the who, what,\n    when, where, and how of creativity in engineering.page: 32\n\n\n\u2022 The Person addresses the factors relating to the psychology of\nthe individual actor involved in the creation of the perceptible\nproduct.\nPerson \u2022 Research has shown that personal properties (e.g., optimism,\nopenness, self-confidence), motivation (both intrinsic and\nextrinsic), and feelings (e.g., excitement, hope, fear) are distinct\ndimensions of the Person that each have a bearing on creativity\n.\n\u2022 Furthermore, these dimensions of the Person interact with each\nother in a variety of ways such that different combinations have\nunique consequences for creativity.page: 33\n\n\n\u2022 The Product addresses the output of the creative endeavor.\n\u2022 Although it is no surprise that psychologists are interested in the creative person, it is also widely accepted that an essential core of creativity, whether in music and poetry, or engineering and science, is the tangible artifact. In fact, this definition of Product can be extended\u2014any product, process, system, or service that is both novel and useful qualifies as a creative product.\n\u2022 For some thing to be considered creative, it must be original and surprising, and it must address a real problem or need.page: 34\n\n\n\u2022 The Process typically addresses the styles of thinking that result in creative products. Although more complex and nuanced than is suggested here, two main thinking styles are commonly associated with creativity.\n\n\u2022 The core of engineering design therefore involves two stages: a stage of creative synthesis (i.e., divergent thinking), followed by a stage of logical analysis (i.e., convergent thinking).page: 35", "metadata": {}}}
