In fact, this definition of Product can be extended\u2014any product, process, system, or service that is both novel and useful qualifies as a creative product.\n\u2022 For some thing to be considered creative, it must be original and surprising, and it must address a real problem or need.page: 34\n\n\n\u2022 The Process typically addresses the styles of thinking that result in creative products. Although more complex and nuanced than is suggested here, two main thinking styles are commonly associated with creativity.\n\n\u2022 The core of engineering design therefore involves two stages: a stage of creative synthesis (i.e., divergent thinking), followed by a stage of logical analysis (i.e., convergent thinking).page: 35\n\n\nThe Process ..Cont..\n\u2022 The core of engineering design therefore\n   involves two stages: a stage of creative\n   synthesis                  (i.e.,           divergent                  thinking),\n   followed by a stage of logical analysis                                                                ?HE\n                                                                              \n         3/1/2024 11:54 AM                                                                                     36page: 36\n\n\nFE PROCESS                                                                                              ..Cont..\n\u2022 It may be tempting to see Process in terms of activities, or procedures, such\n   as brainstorming; however, these are simply a tool to help people recognize\n   and tap into divergent and convergent thinking.\n\u2022 In activities such as engineering, it is also possible to think of Process in\n   terms of the stages that an individual or team undertake as they solve\n   problems and satisfy needs, creatively or otherwise.page: 37\n\n\nThe Finally, the Press examines the role of Press environmental and social factors on creativity. More specifically, Press can be considered to address both (a) how the \u201cclimate\u201d can either facilitate or inhibit creativity, and (b) how the \u201cenvironment\u201d reacts to the production of creativity.page: 38\n\n\n\u2022 Press therefore touches on not only factors such as management support\n   for creativity (e.g., rewarding creativity, encouraging risk taking), and how\n   the physical environment may foster creativity (e.g., through the provision\n   of plants and adequate lighting in the workplace), but also on the way\n   that society tolerates radical deviations from norms (are creative people\n   ridiculed or hailed?), and even the rules and standards that govern\n   professional activities such as engineering.page: 39", "metadata": {}}}
